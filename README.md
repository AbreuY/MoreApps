# More Apps in Play Store

<h4> As a individual developer i have to cope paste some common code to add "More Apps" feature in my applications. It's pathetic to add common codes in all applications and some times it makes silly mistake and have to fix it again. So i think why don't i made a library just write two/three line code and get all the features.</h4>
